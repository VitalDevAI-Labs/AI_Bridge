---

## Context

- **Branch / Environment**: `<feature/branch-name>`
- **Dependencies**: `<tasks, services, approvals>`
- **Constraints / Assumptions**: `<timeouts, OS limits, timeline>`
- **Related Work**: `<links to other task logs or decision docs>`

---

## Plan

2. `<Step>`

---

## Steps Taken

Chronological log of what actually happened. Include commands, files, and reasoning when helpful.

1. `<Action>`
2. `<Action>`

## Challenges & Resolutions

| Challenge | Impact | Resolution | Follow-up |
|-----------|--------|------------|-----------|
| `<issue>` | `<blocked feature?>` | `<how you solved it>` | `<future action or null>` |

---

## Validation

- **Manual**: `<steps run, devices used>`
- **Automated**: `<test suites or commands>`
- **Result**: `pass | fail (explain)`

---

## Outcome

State whether the goal was achieved and highlight key wins or gaps.

- `[ ]` `<Deliverable or acceptance criterion>`

## Next Steps

1. `<Immediate follow-up>`
2. `<Pending decision or future enhancement>`

Include owners if different from the current contributor.
